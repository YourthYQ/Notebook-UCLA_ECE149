## **1. Representation of 2D Signals**

#### 1.1 Definition of 2D Signals

A **2D signal** is a mathematical function that depends on two independent variables. Typically, these variables represent spatial coordinates, like x and y, rather than time (as in 1D signals). The signal’s value at any point (x,y) gives information about the intensity or amplitude at that location.

- **Mathematical Representation:** f(x,y)
- Here, x and y are the spatial coordinates, and f(x,y) represents the value of the signal (e.g., pixel intensity in an image) at the point (x,y).

#### 1.2 Examples of 2D Signals

- **Digital Image (Grayscale):** The intensity of a pixel at coordinate (x,y) in a grayscale image is represented by f(x,y), where x and y denote the pixel's row and column, respectively.

  Example: A 512x512 image can be seen as a matrix where each element corresponds to a pixel intensity.

- **Temperature Map:** A geographical map where f(x,y) represents the temperature at the spatial coordinates (x,y).

- **Surface Plot:** A 2D signal can also represent variations in elevation (e.g., topography).

---

## **2. Continuous vs. Discrete Signals**

#### 2.1 Continuous 2D Signals

A **continuous 2D signal** is a function of two continuous variables. Such signals are mathematically described using continuous coordinates x and y. These are often encountered in theoretical analysis or when dealing with analog signals (e.g., physical measurements).

#### **Example:**

- $$
  f(x, y) = \sin(2\pi x) \sin(2\pi y)
  $$

-  This function represents a continuous wave pattern in both the x- and y-directions.

#### 2.2 Discrete 2D Signals

A **discrete 2D signal** is **defined only at specific points** on a 2D grid (e.g., an image). Discrete signals are common in digital systems, such as digital images, where the signal is represented as a matrix of values.

- **Mathematical Representation:** A discrete 2D signal can be represented as:

- $$
  f[m,n] \quad \text{for integer values of } m \text{ and } n
  $$

- Here, m and n are integers representing discrete positions (e.g., pixel indices in an image).

#### **2.3 Sampling (Continuous to Discrete Conversion)**

To convert a continuous signal into a discrete one, **sampling** is used. Sampling involves taking values from the continuous signal at specific intervals. The **sampling rate** (how often you take samples) determines the resolution of the resulting discrete signal.

- **Sampling Process:**

- $$
  f[m,n] = f\left(x = mT_x, y = nT_y\right)
  $$

- Where ***Tx*** and ***Ty*** are the sampling intervals in the x- and y-directions, respectively.

## 3. 2D Step and Impulse Functions

> In 2D signal processing, **step functions** and **impulse functions** are foundational concepts that are used to describe signals or images mathematically. Here’s an explanation of each:

### 1. 2D Step Function
A **step function** (also known as the Heaviside function) in 2D is used to model signals that have a sudden transition from one value to another. In the 1D case, it jumps from 0 to 1 at a certain point; in 2D, the jump happens along a line or surface. 

Mathematically, the 2D step function can be written as:

$$
u(x, y) =
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \text{ and } y \geq 0\\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
$$

- **Interpretation**: The function is zero everywhere for negative values of \(x\) or \(y\) and jumps to 1 when both \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative. This is useful for describing signals that have a sharp edge, for example, an image that transitions from black to white.

- **Applications**: In image processing, 2D step functions are often used to describe regions of an image where the intensity changes abruptly (e.g., edges or boundaries).

### 2. 2D Impulse Function (Dirac Delta Function)
The **impulse function** (or Dirac delta function) in 2D is a mathematical idealization of a point signal or a signal that is zero everywhere except at a single point, where it is infinitely large in such a way that its integral over the whole space equals 1.

The 2D Dirac delta function, denoted as \( delta(x, y) \), is defined as:

$$
\delta(x, y) =
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } (x, y) = (0, 0) \\
0 & \text{if } (x, y) \neq (0, 0)
\end{cases}
$$

This function has the following property:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(x, y) \, dx \, dy = 1
$$

- **Interpretation**: The impulse function represents a signal that has all of its energy concentrated at a single point. In practice, it’s used to model point sources or events that are localized at a single point in time or space.

- **Applications**: In image processing, the 2D delta function is often used to model a single bright pixel in an otherwise dark image, or as part of convolution operations (for example, in filter kernels). It's also used in system response analysis, where the response of a system to an impulse can be studied.

### Relationship between Step and Impulse Functions

- The **derivative** of the 2D step function is the 2D **impulse function**.
  
- In other words, while the step function represents a sudden change, the impulse function can be thought of as the "rate of change" at that boundary point.

## 4. 2D Complex Exponential Functions

> The **complex exponential** is a foundational concept in signal processing, especially in the context of **2D signals**. Complex exponentials are used to represent oscillations and are central to Fourier transforms, which decompose signals into sinusoidal components.

### 1. Function definition

In two dimensions, a complex exponential signal is written as:

$$
f(x, y) = e^{j(2\pi (u_0 x + v_0 y))}
$$

Where:

- \( `x` \) and \( `y` \) are the spatial coordinates.
- \( `u0` \) and \( `v0` \) are the **spatial frequencies** in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions, respectively.
- \( `j` \) is the imaginary unit, where \( `j^2 = -1` \).
- The term \( `2pi (u0x + v0y)` \) is the phase of the signal.

#### Key Components:

- **Magnitude**: The magnitude of the complex exponential is always 1, since:

$$
|e^{j\theta}| = 1
$$

This means the complex exponential represents a pure oscillation with no decay or growth in amplitude.

- **Phase**: The phase is determined by the term \( `2pi (u0x + v0y)` \), which controls the oscillatory behavior in space.

### 2. Interpretation of the 2D Complex Exponential

The complex exponential can be thought of as a **plane wave** in two dimensions, oscillating along both the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes. The spatial frequencies \( u0 \) and \( v0 \) dictate how rapidly the signal oscillates in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions.

#### Real and Imaginary Parts:

Using **Euler’s formula**, the complex exponential can be written as:

$$
e^{j\theta} = \cos(\theta) + j \sin(\theta)
$$

Thus, in 2D, the complex exponential becomes:

$$
e^{j(2\pi (u_0 x + v_0 y))} = \cos(2\pi (u_0 x + v_0 y)) + j \sin(2\pi (u_0 x + v_0 y))
$$

This means that the real part of the complex exponential is a 2D cosine wave, and the imaginary part is a 2D sine wave. Both are periodic functions in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions.

#### Visualizing the 2D Complex Exponential:

- **Real Part**: A cosine wave that oscillates in 2D space.
- **Imaginary Part**: A sine wave that oscillates similarly.
- **Combined Behavior**: The entire complex exponential describes a rotating vector (in the complex plane) that moves through both the real and imaginary parts as \(x\) and \(y\) vary.

### 3. Periodicity in the Complex Exponential

The complex exponential is **periodic** in both \(x\) and \(y\) because the cosine and sine functions are periodic with a period of \(***2pi***\). This means:
$$
e^{j2\pi(u_0(x+T_x) + v_0(y+T_y))} = e^{j2\pi(u_0x + v_0y)}
$$

Where \(***Tx***\) and \(***Ty***\) are the periods in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions, respectively.

### 3.1 Periodicity in the Spatial Domain

The complex exponential is **periodic in the spatial domain**, meaning the pattern of oscillations will repeat at regular intervals in space. This can be seen from the fact that the complex exponential, like sine and cosine, is inherently periodic with a period of \(2pi\).

#### Mathematical Expression for Periodicity:

The complex exponential is periodic in space if there exist integers \(***Tm***\) and \(***Tn***\) such that:

$$
f[m + T_m, n + T_n] = f[m, n]
$$

For the 2D complex exponential:

$$
e^{j(2\pi(u_0(m + T_m) + v_0(n + T_n)))} = e^{j(2\pi(u_0m + v_0n))}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
2\pi(u_0T_m + v_0T_n) = 2\pi k \quad (\text{for some integer } k)
$$

So the signal is periodic if the spatial frequencies \(u0\) and \(v0\) lead to this condition being met for some values of \(Tm\) and \(Tn\).

## 4. System Properties in 2D Signal Processing: Stability, Causality, Linearity, and Space Invariance

> When analyzing **2D systems**, it’s important to understand key properties that define how these systems behave. These properties include **stability**, **causality**, **linearity**, and **space invariance**

### 1. Stability

A 2D system is said to be **stable** if a bounded input always produces a bounded output. This is also called the **bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO)** stability criterion.

#### Definition:

A system is **stable** if for any input \( f(x, y) \) that satisfies:

$$
|f(x, y)| < B_f \quad \text{for all } x, y
$$

(where \( Bf \) is a constant bound on the input signal), the output \( g(x, y) \) also satisfies:

$$
|g(x, y)| < B_g \quad \text{for all } x, y
$$

(where \( Bg \) is a constant bound on the output signal).

#### Mathematical Condition:

For a 2D linear shift-invariant (LSI) system with impulse response \( h(x, y) \), the system is stable if the impulse response is absolutely summable:

$$
\sum_{x=-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{y=-\infty}^{\infty} |h(x, y)| < \infty
$$

### 2. Causality

For 1D systems, **causality** is defined as the property where the system’s output at any time point depends only on the current and past input values, not on future inputs. However, causality in **2D systems** is more nuanced because it applies to spatial dimensions, not time.

#### Definition:

A 2D system is **causal** if the output at any spatial point \((x0, y0)\) depends only on the input at that point and possibly other points from a defined **causal region** (e.g., earlier or neighboring spatial points) but not on "future" points.

For practical purposes, the concept of **causality** in 2D systems is less relevant because it is primarily a concept in temporal systems. In 2D systems (such as image processing), most systems are treated as **non-causal** since the entire image can be processed at once. However, the concept can be adapted to processing an image from the upper left corner to the lower right, in which case pixels to the left or above a point would be considered "past" information.

### 3. Linearity

A 2D system is **linear** if it satisfies the properties of **superposition** and **scaling**. In other words, a system is linear if the response to a weighted sum of inputs is the same as the weighted sum of the individual responses.

#### Definition:

A system is **linear** if, for any two input signals \(f1(x, y)\) and \(f2(x, y)\), and any constants \(a\) and \(b\), the following condition holds:

$$
S \{ a f_1(x, y) + b f_2(x, y) \} = a S \{ f_1(x, y) \} + b S \{ f_2(x, y) \}
$$

Where:

- \(S\) represents the system,
- \(f1(x, y)\) and \(f2(x, y)\) are the input signals,
- \(a\) and \(b\) are scalar constants.

### 4. Space Invariance (Shift Invariance)

A 2D system is said to be **space-invariant** (or shift-invariant) if the behavior of the system does not change when the input signal is shifted in space. This means that the system's response to an input signal will be the same regardless of where the signal is located in the spatial domain.

#### Definition:

A 2D system is **space-invariant** if, for any shift \(x0\) and \(y0\), the system satisfies:

$$
S \{ f(x - x_0, y - y_0) \} = g(x - x_0, y - y_0)
$$

Where:

- \(S\) is the system,
- \(f(x, y)\) is the input signal,
- \(g(x, y)\) is the output signal.

This means that if you shift the input \(f(x, y)\) by \((x0, y0)\), the output \(g(x, y)\) will also be shifted by the same amount \((x0, y0)\), without altering its characteristics.

## 5. 2D Convolution in Signal Processing

> The **2D convolution** of two signals (or functions) is a mathematical operation that produces a new signal by "sliding" one signal (called the filter or kernel) over another signal (often an image) and computing the sum of pointwise multiplications at each position.
>
> Convolution allows us to apply a filter (or kernel) to an image or 2D signal, altering it in some controlled way, such as blurring, sharpening, or detecting edges.

### 1. Continuous Case:

For continuous 2D signals \(f(x, y)\) and a kernel \(h(x, y)\), the 2D convolution is defined as:

$$
g(x, y) = (f * h)(x, y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(a, b) h(x - a, y - b) \, da \, db
$$

Where:

- \(f(x, y)\) is the **input signal** (such as an image),
- \(h(x, y)\) is the **filter** (or kernel) being applied,
- \(g(x, y)\) is the **output signal** (the result of the convolution),
- \(a\) and \(b\) are the integration variables representing the coordinates within the input signal.

---

### 2. Discrete Case:

For digital images or discrete 2D signals (which is the most common case in practice), the 2D convolution becomes a **sum** instead of an integral:

$$
g[m, n] = (f * h)[m, n] = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} h[i, j] f[m - i, n - j]
$$

Where:

- \(g[m, n]\) is the **output** at pixel \((m, n)\),
- \(f[m, n]\) is the **input signal** at pixel \((m, n)\),
- \(h[i, j]\) is the **filter** (or kernel).

This operation applies the filter to each pixel of the input signal by multiplying the values of the filter with the corresponding pixel values in the image and summing the results.
